This blade has a dark past.

2
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.800  line:-4
It has shed much innocent blood.

3
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.450  line:-4
You're a fool for traveling alone,
so completely unprepared.

4
00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.800  line:-4
You're lucky your blood's still flowing.

5
00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.300  line:-4
Thank you.

6
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.000  line:-4
So...

7
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.800  line:-5
What brings you to
the land of the gatekeepers?

8
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.500  line:-4
I'm searching for someone.

9
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.200  line:-5
Someone very dear?
A kindred spirit?

10
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.000  line:-4
A dragon.

11
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.750  line:-4
A dangerous quest for a lone hunter.

12
00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.870  line:-5
I've been alone for
as long as I can remember.

13
00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.500  line:-4
We're almost done. Shhh...
