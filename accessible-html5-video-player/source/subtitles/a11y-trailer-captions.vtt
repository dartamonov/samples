00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:11.530	line:-3
<v Gian Wild>It's unfortunate the level of discrimination that I have seen, and it's the same in the

2
00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:18.220	line:-3
U.S. as it is in Australia. It's one of the last bastions of discrimination. People are

3
00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:23.060	line:-3
happy to talk about racial discrimination, they're happy to talk about gender discrimination,

4
00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:31.359	line:-3
or sexuality discrimination, or sexual orientation discrimination, but disability discrimination—no

5
00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:36.750	line:-3
one's really talking about that. That's why I think social media is so important,

6
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.810	line:-3
because it gives people with disabilities the opportunity to interact with others without

7
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:46.290	line:-3
disclosing that they have a disability. And that might not seem like a big deal, but when

8
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.570	line:-3
you've been discriminated your entire life because you're blind, or you're in a wheelchair,

9
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.210 	line:-3
or you're quadriplegic, and you can just talk to people without them even knowing, it makes

10
00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:02.420	line:-3
a massive difference. Which is one reason why I want social media to be accessible...and it's not.

11
00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.909	line:-3
<v Elise Keith>The key underlying assumption you have

12
00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:12.090	line:-3
to have is that these are people who access the internet [laughs]. And as people

13
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:19.609	line:-3
who access the internet, they have the skills and the tools to read content on the internet.

14
00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:27.069	line:-3
You know, they can go to a website and read a blog article. Your job is just to make sure

15
00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:30.909	line:-3
that you've got your basics covered, that you actually—if it's a paragraph, you make

16
00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:35.780	line:-3
it a paragraph, and if it's a heading, add an H1 or H2 or whatever. You don't have to

17
00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:44.499 	line:-3
get that fancy. And in fact, the fancier you get, the more difficult it's going to be to test, and maintain, and

18
00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:51.249 	line:-3
make its way through all of these layers, so, get your basics right. Basic, basic, basic!

19
00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:57.319	line:-3
<v Sina Bahram>The good news for me is, I've never had a conversation with developers that—after

20
00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:04.319 	line:-3
which, they left the conversation and said, "I was right, it's really difficult. Wow,

21
00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:09.110	line:-3
totally not going to do accessibility." Instead, the response that is most common, I've heard

22
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.670	line:-3
it hundreds of times, is, "Oh wait, is that it?" And then you have a conversation, "Well,

23
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.530	line:-3
that's most of it. We have to consider a few things, and get things to a certain state,

24
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.860	line:-3
here's the standard, but yeah—that's basically it." So by dispelling this fear that it's

25
00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.520	line:-3
going to be this huge process and this complete throwaway of everything that they've done—because

26
00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.420	line:-3
remember, they're proud of the thing that they've created. You want to make sure that

27
00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.750	line:-3
you're helping them to make that thing better, not just calling their baby ugly.

28
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.170	line:-3
<v Marcy Sutton>Each conference talk I do, and each thing I write, I get so many people who either,

29
00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.820	line:-3
they're saying, "Yes, thank you for coming and talking about this," or they're saying

30
00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.740	line:-3
"I'd never even considered that before," and when I get feedback like that, that's how

31
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:57.320	line:-3
you make change happen. You go and win people over who are doing the work, and then they will go and make a difference.

32
00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.510	line:-3
<v John Keith>I can only speak for myself. I can't imagine

33
00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.480	line:-3
sleeping well at night, going, "Yeah, I really made a lot of money on the backs of people

34
00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:11.130 	line:-3
who have accessibility needs, I'm so happy for myself." I'd feel a lot better if I say,

35
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:17.520	line:-3
"We really helped a lot of people by going the extra mile." [laughs] You know? And it

36
00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.120	line:-3
turns out the extra mile wasn't that hard. It just required us to actually point ourselves

37
00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.120	line:-3
in that direction and keep going. [chuckles]
